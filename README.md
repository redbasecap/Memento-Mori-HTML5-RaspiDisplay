# Memento Mori Calendar

## Description

A visual reminder of life's finite nature, inspired by the Stoic practice of "Memento Mori" (Remember that you will die). This calendar represents each week of your life as a small square - filled squares show weeks you've already lived, empty ones represent your potential future.

The calendar is built with clean HTML5, CSS3, and vanilla JavaScript, featuring a minimalist design with the elegant Geist font.
